# Neural_Network
Repository that contains my first Neural Network library

There are 2 Neural Networks in this repository. The boring_NN is a neural network that has a fixed amount of layers (one input, one hidden and one output). The other one is an attempt to make one with multiple hidden layers, but it isn't working properly __YET__.
